# BackyardFlyer
In this project we must use event driven programming in order to fly autonomously a drone. All the action will happen in a Unity simulator, flying a quadcopter.

### Drone API
To link with the drone, we will be using the [Udacidrone API](https://udacity.github.io/udacidrone/). It's providing a way to communicate with the quadcopter. The API is basically designed in two parts: a Drone class and a set of connection classes. The goal of this project is to design a subclass from the Drone class implementing a state machine to autonomously fly a box.

### And here is the final result
